## Antibody Classification Task

This project will take raw antibody sequences, and use deep learning in a pipeline automated with snakemake to classify
them as having therapeutic potential. 

It is an ongoing exploration meant to sharpen my skills with pytorch, snakemake, further my understanding of 
antibody structure and function and the challenges associated with translating said challenges into computational 
frameworks.
